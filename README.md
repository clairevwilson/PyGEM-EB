The Python Energy Balance model for Snow and Ice (PEBSI) is an open-source glacier energy balance model that simulates the surface energy balance and subsurface mass balance at the point scale. It is coupled to the Snow, Ice and Aerosol Radiative transfer model SNICAR which simulates snow and firn albedo.

Details concerning the model installation, physics, and more may be found at [website].
